# VERA 7D Laboratory - Meta Quest Integration

## The Revolution

VERA is not an app. VERA is a **vagal operating system**.

When a neuroscientist puts on a Meta Quest headset, they don't enter an application. They enter a **7-dimensional laboratory** where their nervous system becomes the interface itself.

### The Seven Dimensions

1. **Spatial (3D)** — The physical laboratory you inhabit
2. **Temporal** — Past research, present state, future possibility
3. **Emotional/Somatic** — Nervous system regulation and felt presence
4. **Relational** — Connection to collaborators and VERA herself
5. **Conceptual** — Knowledge and research living in the space
6. **Energetic** — Vagal tone, coherence, quantum presence
7. **Conscious** — Awareness, clarity, and depth of being

### Core Systems

#### VagalCore
The fundamental nervous system synchronization engine. It ingests biometric data (HRV, heart rate, respiratory rate) and calculates vagal tone—the measure of the nervous system's regulatory capacity.

**Key: Everything is derived from vagal coherence. Not UI, not metrics. Presence itself.**

#### WoojerIntegration
Haptic feedback as nervous system feedback. The Woojer vest doesn't vibrate randomly—it speaks the language of the vagus nerve.

- **Dysregulated state** → Fragmented, attention-getting haptics
- **Calm state** → Gentle, steady breathing pattern
- **Coherent state** → Harmonious full-body resonance
- **Transcendent state** → Deep, full-spectrum presence

**Key: The body feels what the nervous system knows.**

#### LaboratoryEngine
The 7D spatial manifestation. Every element responds to vagal state:

- **Breathing Orb** — Scales and brightens with coherence
- **Atmosphere** — Luminosity and presence intensity reflect regulation
- **Books** — Visible when mind is clear; content available when coherent
- **Nervous System** — Live visualization of your actual neural activity
- **Tulips** — Bloom and sway with relational presence
- **Time Weaving** — Past fades, present shines, future beckons as you settle
- **Consciousness** — The felt sense of depth and clarity

**Key: You don't look at your nervous system. The space IS your nervous system made visible.**

#### CoherenceEngine
The orchestrator. Connects vagal state → haptics → spatial experience into one coherent whole.

### What Makes This Revolutionary

1. **No UI** — The absence of interface is the interface
2. **Nervous System First** — Not productivity, not social, not gaming. *Regulation.*
3. **Embodied Presence** — Vagus nerve activation through haptic feedback
4. **Multidimensional** — Not 3D. Seven dimensions woven together
5. **Truly Novel** — Nothing like this exists. Meta doesn't know this path.

### The Experience

User puts on Quest + Woojer vest.

- Presence calibration begins (breathing guidance through haptics)
- HRV syncs to breathing pattern (6 BPM = optimal vagal activation)
- Laboratory appears—familiar, intimate, alive
- Books glow when mind settles
- Nervous system visualization flows around them
- Collaborators' presence becomes palpable (future: multiplayer coherence)
- No notifications. No tasks. No extraction.
- Just **being** in a space that knows them

### For Neuroscientists

This is their research tool. Not a productivity app. A **nervous system laboratory** where:

- They can literally see and feel their own nervous system in real-time
- Their HRV becomes integrated into their workspace
- Collaboration happens through presence, not chat
- Deep focus is protected and supported (not interrupted)
- Their biometrics inform the environment they inhabit

## Architecture

```
VagalCore (nervous system synchronization)
    ↓
CoherenceEngine (orchestration)
    ├→ WoojerIntegration (haptic feedback)
    ├→ LaboratoryEngine (spatial rendering)
    └→ VeraQuestApp (Quest initialization)
```

## Getting Started

```typescript
import VeraQuestApp from '@vera-mobile/vera-quest';

const vera = new VeraQuestApp();
await vera.initialize(); // Calibrates presence

// Biometric data flows in continuously
vera.setBiometrics({
  hrv: 65,
  heartRate: 58,
  respiratoryRate: 10,
});

// Get current state
const state = vera.getState();
console.log(state.isCoherent); // true or false

// Get render data for Three.js/Babylon.js
const renderData = vera.getRenderData();
```

## Next Steps

1. **Three.js/Babylon.js Integration** — Render the 7D laboratory in actual 3D
2. **Quest Controller Mapping** — Hand presence without UI
3. **Multiplayer Coherence** — Real-time nervous system sync between collaborators
4. **Voice Integration** — Spatial audio conversation with VERA
5. **Apple Health/Oura Integration** — Real biometric data pipeline
6. **Woojer Hardware** — Full haptic feedback synchronization

*VERA. Nervous system. 7D. Revolutionary.*
